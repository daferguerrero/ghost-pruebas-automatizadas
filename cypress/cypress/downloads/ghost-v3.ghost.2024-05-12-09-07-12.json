Rather\nthan giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for code, we just\nlet you write code.\n\nMarketplace\nThere are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can\ndownload from the Ghost Theme Marketplace [https://ghost.org/marketplace/]:\n\nAnyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme with some solid knowledge of\nHTML and CSSTheme development\nGhost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has\na set of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. For example: \n{{author.name}} outputs the name of the current author.\n\nThe best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at \nthe\nsource code for Casper [https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper], which is heavily\ncommented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.\n\n\n * default.hbs is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this\n   file unless specifically told to use a different template.\n * post.hbs is the file used in the context of viewing a post.\n * index.hbs is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.\n * and so on\n\nWe've got full and extensive theme documentation\n[https://ghost.org/docs/themes/] which outlines every template file, context and\nhelper that you can use. You can also get started with our useful starter theme\n[https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter/], which includes the most common\nfoundations and components required to build your own theme.\n\n> If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or\nhelp, there's also a themes section on our public Ghost forum\n[https://forum.ghost.org/c/themes].","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/creating-a-custom-theme.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2024-05-11 23:52:56","updated_at":"2024-05-11 23:52:56","published_at":"2024-05-11 23:52:56","custom_excerpt":"Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme designed for publishers which can easily be adapted for most purposes, or you can build a custom theme to suit your needs.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"664004d8fad34500014650bb","uuid":"a543f60d-3048-4715-9241-7138c7e18bf9","title":"Apps & integrations","slug":"apps-integrations","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/integrations-icons.png\",\"cardWidth\":\"full\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<script src=\\\"https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=Ghost&container=true&limit=8\\\"></script>\\n\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/integrations-and-webhooks-in-ghost.png\",\"alt\":\"Screenshot of custom integrations with webhooks in Ghost Admin\",\"cardWidth\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/integrations/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://zapier.com\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"/themes/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Work with your existing tools\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to connect your Ghost site to hundreds of the most popular apps and tools using integrations that take no more than a few minutes to setup.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Whether you need to automate workflows, connect your email list, build a community or embed products from your ecommerce store, our \"],[0,[0],1,\"integrations library\"],[0,[],0,\" has got it all covered with hundreds of tutorials.\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Zapier\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"On top of this, you can connect your Ghost site to more than 1,000 external services using the official integration with \"],[0,[1],1,\"Zapier\"],[0,[],0,\".\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Zapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create and customise a wide range of connected applications.\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[2],1,\"Example\"],[0,[],0,\": When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[2],1,\"Here are the most popular Ghost<>Zapier automation templates:\"],[0,[],0,\" \"]]],[10,1],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Custom integrations\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"At the heart of Ghost sits a robust JSON API – designed to create, manage and retrieve content with ease. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to create custom Ghost integrations with dedicated API keys and webhooks from the Integrations page within Ghost Admin. \"]]],[10,2],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Beyond that, the API allows you to build entirely custom publishing apps.
